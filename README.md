==========
In this assignment you will write a JavaScript program using p5 that simulates the Lights Out electronic game that was released by Tiger Electronics in 1995. [Wikipedia has a good article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) that describes the game, and you can see an [old commercial for the game on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj0lVmhkx7M).
