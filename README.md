Lights Out
==========
![](2880px-LightsOutIllustration.svg.png)   
In this assignment you will write a JavaScript program using p5 that simulates the Lights Out electronic game that was released by Tiger Electronics in 1995. [Wikipedia has a good article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) that describes the game, and you can see an [old commercial for the game on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj0lVmhkx7M). You can play the lights out game online [here](https://www.logicgamesonline.com/lightsout/).

When you play the game, you could magine that your job is managing at a power plant in Los Angeles. It is a hot summer night and a brown-out has hit the entire city leaving millions of people in darkness. You need to turn all the lights back on as quickly as possible. Hooking up gas generators in each of the major areas of the city should do the trick, however the generators are a bit tricky when it comes to powering an entire city. One generator can power 5 city blocks: one central block, and one block each in the north, south, east, and west directions. However, if two generators try to power the same city block, they short out. In order to win the game you must turn all the lights for every block in the city.

Program requirements
--------------------
* Your lights out game must have at least a 5 x 5 grid that uses an 2d array. (Look at the example on slide ? of the slide presentation for one way to use a 2d array oto represent the grid.) 
* Customize the HTML and CSS of the web page that displays your game.  
* Submit the URL of your game to Google classroom using the "present" link on p5.

Extensions
-----------
If you have extra time, you may want to add features to your game to make it more challenging. You could make a game with different levels of difficulty. One way to make the game more challenging is to start with a different randomly lit buttons. Be warned though that not all arrangements are solvable!

[Wolfram Math World](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LightsOutPuzzle.html) has a good web page that explains The mathematics of the Lights Out Puzzle. (The field of math that is used to solve the Lights Out puzzle is called "linear algebra")
